## 📋 Game Overview

### The Goal
Be the last player with Influence. Eliminate all other players by forcing them to lose their influence cards.

### Setup
- Each player starts with **2 Coins** and **2 Influence Cards** (face-down)
- The Court Deck contains **15 cards** (3 copies of each character)

### Characters

| Character | Action | Effect | Counteraction |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Duke** | Tax | Take 3 coins | Blocks Foreign Aid |
| **Assassin** | Assassinate | Pay 3 coins, target loses influence | — |
| **Captain** | Steal | Take 2 coins from another player | Blocks Stealing |
| **Ambassador** | Exchange | Draw 2 cards, return 2 to deck | Blocks Stealing |
| **Contessa** | — | — | Blocks Assassination |

### General Actions (No character required)

| Action | Effect | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Income** | Take 1 coin | Cannot be blocked or challenged |
| **Foreign Aid** | Take 2 coins | Can be blocked by Duke |
| **Coup** | Pay 7 coins, target loses influence | Cannot be blocked or challenged |

### The Golden Rule 🎭
**You can perform ANY character action, even if you don't have that character card!**

- If no one challenges → Your action succeeds
- If challenged and you're bluffing → You lose an influence
- If challenged and you have the card → The challenger loses an influence

### Critical Rule ⚠️
**If you start your turn with 10+ coins, you MUST Coup!**

## 🎨 Customizing Character Art

The game includes placeholder SVG cards. To use custom artwork:

1. Generate or create your character images (recommended size: 200x280px)
2. Replace the files in `client/public/cards/`:
   - `duke.svg`
   - `assassin.svg`
   - `captain.svg`
   - `ambassador.svg`
   - `contessa.svg`
   - `card-back.svg`

### Image Generation Prompts

For realistic character portraits, use these prompts with AI image generators:

**Duke:**
> A realistic oil-painting style portrait of a corrupt, wealthy politician. He is an older man with graying hair, wearing a high-collared velvet coat and a heavy gold ring. He is holding a gold coin up to the light. His expression is arrogant and greedy. Upper body shot, neutral background.

**Assassin:**
> A realistic portrait of a female assassin in stealth gear. She wears a dark hood partially obscuring her face, but her intense eyes are visible. She holds a small blade. Practical leather and cloth gear. Cold, focused expression. Dark, moody lighting, upper body shot.

**Captain:**
> A realistic portrait of a military general. A tough middle-aged man with a scar on his cheek, wearing a standard military dress uniform with medals. Authoritative and stern expression. Warm lighting, upper body shot.

**Ambassador:**
> A realistic portrait of a diplomat or merchant. A well-dressed man in fine silk clothing, holding a sealed scroll. He has a charming but deceptive smile. Soft lighting, embassy background, upper body shot.

**Contessa:**
> A realistic portrait of a powerful noblewoman. She wears an elegant red dress and expensive jewelry. She holds a traditional folding fan near her face, looking over it with a sharp, calculating gaze. Calm but dangerous expression. Luxurious background, upper body shot.
